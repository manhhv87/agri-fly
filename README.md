# Flight Simulator in Agricultural Environment
This project is a simulator for autonomous flight in agricultural environment. 
It can be used to test different strategies of autonomous flights. 


# Overview
1. The flight simulator code, including physics and example estimator and controller are based on work of HiPeRLab (https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/). Specically, the RAPPIDS(https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020_RectangularPyramid.pdf) is used for onboard path planning. 

2. The high-fidelity argricultral models used in the project comes from Helios(https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/software/helios/) developed by Bailey Lab of UC Davis.

3. Rendering of the argricultral world is implemented with Unity (https://unity.com/). The tool is not open source and not free to use, but Unity provides personal/educator license that can be easily obtained without charge. 

4. The visualization and sensor fabrication is built upon AirSim, especially its pilot Unity simulation demo.
