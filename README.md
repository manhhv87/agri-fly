# agri-fly
Simulator for autonomous flight in agricultural enthronement. 
Can be used to test different strategies of autonomous flights. 

1. The flight simulator code, including physics and example controller are based on work of HiPeRLab (https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/). Specically, the RAPPIDS(https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020_RectangularPyramid.pdf) is used for onboard path planning. 
2. The high-fidelity argricultral models used in the project comes from Helios(https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/software/helios/) developed by Bailey lab of UC Davis.
3. Rendering of the argricultral world is implemented with Unity(https://unity.com/). The tool is not open source and not free to use, but provides personal/educator license that can be easily obtained without charge. 
4. The connection behind physics code and Unity was implemented with the MicroSoft's AirSim' AirLib Library. It is a open source project with good simulation results.
